## About Me
Hello! I'm Erik Arvidsson, a PhD student in Machine Design at Lule√• University of Technology, where I also completed my MSc in Mechanical Engineering. My current research focuses on **Autonomous Forest Regeneration**, particularly with mixed tree species. My goal is to enhance forest regeneration processes through autonomy, whilst ensuring sustainable practices.

Currently, I am working on **Coverage Path Planning** in forest terrain, where I aim to develop efficient algorithms for autonomous vehicles navigating complex forest environments.

## Research Focus
- Autonomous Forest Regeneration
- Enabling the shift from conifer monocultures to mixed-species forests
- Coverage Path Planning (CPP)
